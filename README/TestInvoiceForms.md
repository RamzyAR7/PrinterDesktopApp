   - Add items to invoice
   - Set customer details
   - Save invoice

## Implementation Architecture

The invoice CRUD follows the same successful pattern as the product CRUD:

```
InvoiceForm (Main List)
├── CRUD Buttons (New, Edit, Delete)
├── Search functionality
├── Grid with Arabic formatting
└── Integration with InvoiceCUForm

InvoiceCUForm (Create/Update)
├── Invoice header fields
├── Cascading product selection
├── Items grid management
├── Real-time calculations
└── Database operations
```

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready invoice management system with comprehensive CRUD operations, following DevExpress best practices and Arabic localization requirements.
