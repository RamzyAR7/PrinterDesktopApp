# Fixed IsDeleted Filters in Invoice and Product Forms

## ✅ **COMPLETED**: IsDeleted Filters Added

### **Fixed in InvoiceCUForm.cs**

1. **LoadComboBoxData()** - Added `!c.IsDeleted` filter for companies:
   ```csharp
   var companies = dbContext.Companies
       .Where(c => !c.IsDeleted)  // ✅ ADDED
       .Select(c => new { c.Id, c.Name })
       .OrderBy(c => c.Name)
       .ToList();
   ```

2. **LoadCategories()** - Added `!c.IsDeleted` filter for categories:
   ```csharp
   var categories = dbContext.Categories
       .Where(c => !c.IsDeleted)  // ✅ ADDED
       .Select(c => new { c.Id, c.Name })
       .OrderBy(c => c.Name)
       .ToList();
   ```

3. **LoadProducts()** - Added `!p.IsDeleted` filter for products:
   ```csharp
   var products = dbContext.Products
       .Where(p => p.CompanyId == companyId && p.CategoryId == categoryId && !p.IsDeleted)  // ✅ ADDED
       .Select(p => new { ... })
   ```

4. **LoadInvoiceForEdit()** - Removed invalid IsDeleted filter from Invoice entity:
   ```csharp
   currentInvoice = dbContext.Invoices
       .Include("InvoiceItems")
       .FirstOrDefault(i => i.Id == invoiceId);  // ✅ REMOVED !i.IsDeleted
   ```

5. **CreateBtn_Click()** - Removed invalid IsDeleted assignment:
   ```csharp
   var newInvoice = new Invoice
   {
       // ... other properties
       // IsDeleted = false  // ✅ REMOVED - Property doesn't exist
   };
   ```

### **Already Correct in ProductCUForm.cs**

✅ **LoadComboBoxData()** - Already has `!c.IsDeleted` for companies  
✅ **LoadCategories()** - Already has `!c.IsDeleted` for categories  

## **Filter Rules Applied**

### **Entities WITH IsDeleted Property** ✅
- **Company**: `!c.IsDeleted` 
- **Category**: `!c.IsDeleted`
- **Product**: `!p.IsDeleted`

### **Entities WITHOUT IsDeleted Property** ✅
- **Invoice**: No IsDeleted filter (property doesn't exist)
- **InvoiceItem**: No IsDeleted filter (property doesn't exist)

## **Result**
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Only non-deleted companies, categories, and products will appear in dropdowns
- ✅ Invoice forms will work correctly without invalid property references
- ✅ Data integrity maintained with proper soft delete filtering

The invoice and product forms now properly respect the soft delete pattern and will only show active (non-deleted) companies, categories, and products in their dropdown selections.
